## Features

### Different sources for question bank
Upload your own JSON file or use a third-party API (there is some simple format checking implemented). If neither of that works for you, click Quickstart to use our default test bank questions.

### Replay the round with the same questions
If you didn't get a perfect score and want to repeat a round with the same questions, you may select to do so at the end of the round.

### High Score
Scores are tracked so you know you are improving, learning and building your knowledge base. If the questions are too elementary, simply clear your high score and climb back to the top!
